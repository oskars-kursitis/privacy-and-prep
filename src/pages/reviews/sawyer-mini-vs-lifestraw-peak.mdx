import ProsCons from "../../components/ProsCons.astro";
import SpecTable from "../../components/SpecTable.astro";

## Verdict
Both work. The **LifeStraw Peak Squeeze** has better flow and fewer clogs; the **Sawyer Mini** wins on price and ubiquity.

{<ProsCons
  pros={["Peak: better flow", "Peak: soft bottle compatibility", "Sawyer: cheap, everywhere"]}
  cons={["Peak: pricier", "Sawyer: slow unless backflushed often"]}
/>}

## Specs
{<SpecTable
  rows={[
    ["Filter type","Hollow fiber (0.1μm)"],
    ["Use","Squeeze/bottle/gravity"],
    ["Weight","~65–100 g"],
    ["Backflush","Yes"]
  ]}
/>}

## Picks
- **Best overall**: LifeStraw Peak Squeeze — [buy](/go/lifestraw-peak/)
- **Budget**: Sawyer Mini — [buy](/go/sawyer-mini/)

## Tips
Backflush after each trip. Don’t freeze a wet filter. Pair with a **clean bag** and a **dirty bag**.
