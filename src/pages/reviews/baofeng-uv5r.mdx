<ProductCard title="Baofeng UV-5R" url="/go/baofeng/" summary="Budget VHF/UHF handheld; huge ecosystem; needs setup." />

## Verdict
If you’ll **program and practice**, the UV-5R is fine for local simplex/monitoring. If you want plug-and-play, buy a **license-free walkie pair** instead: [walkie set](/go/walkie-set/).

<ProsCons
  pros={["Ridiculously cheap", "Dual-band VHF/UHF", "Batteries/antennas everywhere"]}
  cons={["Needs programming (CHIRP)", "Mediocre stock antenna/audio", "Not rugged or waterproof"]}
/>

## Specs
<SpecTable rows={[
["Bands","136–174 / 400–520 MHz"],["Power","1/5 W"],["Battery","~1800 mAh"],["Weight","~214 g"],
["Water","Minimal"],["Programming","USB cable + CHIRP"]
]} />

## Setup in 10 minutes
1. Charge. Swap to a **better antenna**.
2. Program local simplex & weather with CHIRP.
3. Agree primary/backup channels and **check-in times**.
4. Store with **paper cheat sheet** + spare battery.

## Alternatives
- **License-free pair**: easier, less range — [walkie set](/go/walkie-set/).
- **Rugged commercial**: better audio/sealing if budget allows.
