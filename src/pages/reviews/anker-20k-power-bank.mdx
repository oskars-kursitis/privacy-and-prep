<ProductCard title="20,000 mAh USB-C Power Bank" url="/go/power-bank/" summary="Enough for 2–3 phone recharges plus a headlamp." />

## Verdict
A **20k USB-C PD** bank is the best value/weight for most people. It charges phones fast, runs lanterns/headlamps, and pairs well with a **20–28W solar panel**: [panel](/go/solar-panel/).

<ProsCons
  pros={["Great Wh/£", "USB-C PD both ways", "Airline-legal (under 100Wh)"]}
  cons={["Not weatherproof", "Slow to refill from tiny panels"]}
/>

## Specs to look for
<SpecTable rows={[
["Capacity","~20,000 mAh (~72 Wh)"],["Input/Output","USB-C PD 18–30W"],["Ports","USB-C + USB-A"],["Weight","~350–450 g"]

## Buy it if…
- You want **one bank** for outage + travel.
- Your kit includes a foldable **20–28W panel**.

## Skip it if…
- You need laptop charging (get 45–65W, 25–30k mAh instead).
