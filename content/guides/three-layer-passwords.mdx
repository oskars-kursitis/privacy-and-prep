# 3‑Layer Password Strategy

**Goal:** Make account takeovers boring and unlikely.

1. **Layer 1: Throwaways.** Accounts you don't care about. Use a unique random password via your manager.
2. **Layer 2: Important.** Banking, email, social. Unique, long, and with 2FA.
3. **Layer 3: Master Keys.** Email, password manager, SIM. Hardware keys if possible.
